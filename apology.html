		<!-- Reasons -->
		<h2>Reasons why I love you.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>You remind and warn me in a very calm tone when I do or say things I shouldn't. Not once have you ever raised your voice at me even when I've done something wrong.</li>
			<li>Not once did you fail in making me stop my overthinking by reassuring me with your words. You're constantly checking up on me and asking if I'm alright.</li>
			<li>To learn and to grow. You make me a better person with all the things you advise me to do or to say. You teach me all the right and correct mannerisms that are respectful and that nobody has ever told me I was wrong.</li>
			<li>You make me want to be patient. As a person, I'm constantly in a rush and want things to be speedy. You make me think otherwise.</li>
			<li>You're always there for me. Always present even when I'm at my worst.</li>
